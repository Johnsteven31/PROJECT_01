            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <h3>What is life if you don't do something that you enjoy doing. Well somethings I enjoy doing is:</h3>
            <h2>Film</h2>
            <img class="Film-IMG" src="Film_IMG.jfif" alt="">
            <p>My interest in film started at a very young age. As a kid my dad every night he came from work he would always bring a movie dvd of some sort, all the movies would be different genres. My parents didn't mind me watching Rated R movies as a kid so I got to see alot of classic movies that film majors now look at in order to learn.</p>
            <p>Fast foward many years later, I was able to be accepted to a high school where I was able to learn more about the history of film and how to actually work as a team in order to create a film.</p>
            <p>I really enjoyed creating films with classmates and enjoyed the fact that everyone had a piece of the puzzle and without one of them the film would not work at all. I loved the team aspect of film and loved watching the end result as a movie.</p>
            <p>Sadly, after high school my mindset was I could land a job wih film but I wouldn't get the pay I desired in that instury. So I moved on, but until this day I do enjoy taking out my camera for events and being able to film and being able to use what I learned for years. </p>

        <section class="Soccer-Text">
            <h2>Soccer</h2>
            <img class="Soccer-IMG" src="Soccer_IMG.jpg" alt="">
            <P>Soccer has always been a hobby of mine, I'm not the best at it, but I do love playing it.</P>
            <p>Soccer for me was that sorta of thing of when I do  it I completely forget whatever was going on throughout the day or even week. That short period of time it really felt relaxing and like nothing else in the world mattered.</p>
            <p>My interest in soccer has always been with me. My family are very big soccer fans, every sunday we would go out to the park and play against each other. We would play from 11am to around 9pm. We are all very competitve so the games will always be amusing to say the least, because of how bad all of us wanted to win against each other.</p>
            <P>I stopped playing a few years back, but now that I have a huge backyard avaiable to me, I started playing again and I realized I still have the urge and interest in soccer within me, I do plan to keep going since that is the quickest way of staying active after a long day of practicing coding.</P>

        <section class="Remodel-Text">
            <h2>Remodeling</h2>
            <img class="Remodel-IMG" src="Remodel_IMG.jpg" alt="">
            <P>My interest in remodeling is a strange one in my mind. Reason being because I didn't think remodeling could be something I would enjoy. It's pretty new to me, I recently moved into a house and it needed a lot of work done. Since I'm pretty handy when it comes to demolition and rebuilding I took on the task on remodeling the new house.</P>
            <P>What I really enjoy about it is going back and remembering how a specific place looked like and than later on after changing everything to your likely and being able to tell yourself "I did a good fucking job".</P>
            <p>Another aspect that I love about remodeling is being to change anything to your own liking and being able to see your work at your own home, a home isn't truly your home until you put your own twist into things.</p>
